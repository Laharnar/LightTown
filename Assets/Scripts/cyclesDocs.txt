Cycle 1 - hack and slash basics
dope non animated character with hp and one attack.
dope non animated enemy with ai, hp and one attack.
movement. ok
attacking. ok

results: enemies can basically wipe you out when they group. ally feels cool.
currenty you cannot kite enemies, because attacks happen towards where you are facing.
suggestions: slow down enemies - slow ai attacking start. stunned when hit.


Cycle 2 - experiment with ability system and ai. basic ui messaging.
stun. - ok
archer ally. long range. insta shot. - ok
ally dog. stun ability.
more enemies.
stun attribute for ability. stun on hit. player is stunned less.
get basic ui messages out above units. text based.
-ok all

results: dog can tank everything, and it becomes boring to watch them diss it out in melee. ui msgs would look
better if they were spawned and slided down.

(Cycle 2)ability system
combat action is handled by combat processor.  <atm only damage and move> it's move, ability or whatever decision ai or user can make.
where to handle cooldowns on abilities and where to handle ai delays? << locally.
Solution 22.12.18: effects like stuns, animations, and waiting are handled locally. damage and movement are handled globally.

Cycle 3 - include teamwork with allies mechanic. what about picking one ally to follow you.
need visuals.
Activating animations - 
1: in prefs
2: in character... separaate library.
random dmg in range. larger hp value. ok
-- when close to ally, press space, they start following you. ok. attacking activated different attack.
pick ally/leave ally. 3 combo basic attack... space. ability 1. ability 2.
basic ability 1: aoe spin - faster dmg. basic ability 2: drain heal
dog: basic attack: double fast attack(double dmg). ability 1: short aoe bark-stun, no dmg. ability 2: dog jump perma stun 1 target. disengages when lost connection.
archer: a1: slow cloud thrown on player. a2: aoe arrow shot.
camera. ok

TEST: if combos work on enemies.

skopiraj certifikat na svoj strežnik na arnesu. konektaj prek passworda na učilnici.
2.3 namesšanje certifikata - pretvorimo naš signet cert+

// aktivacija certifikata za 1 dan, da se lahko pošilja na gručo
arcproxy $fri.vo.sling.si

run with putty.

// kaj naj se zažene
arcsub -c jost.arnes.si mpi_test.xrsl
ta mpi_test scripta je bash... noter damo našo skripto
few things: where to debug. we need to load it from server

delaj na lokalni mpi, potem pa še zaženi na strežniku.
using bash on server.
cat file.smth

cert na enega od računov. ga pretvori z unimi 3 ukazi. naredi arcproxy. prirpavi naš program in opisno datoteko ki se jo požene.

seminarska.....
je tudi v knjigi. rezanje šivov. rezamo sliko da je ne spreenimo preveč
detekcija robov. potem šive iskat, računanje kumulativ(vsota pi, katere črte pixlov vn.
kumulative: prištej minimum v naslednji vrstici.

import that sigenca certificat. then select mail.

Ideje:
collect army.
pick closest ally to give you 1 ability
pick closest ally to give you attacks.
to assist you in battle. depending on their ai.
the rest they just chill and be more defensive on the side
(invisible sneaky assasin(dark templar slash). mage with huge channeling meteor.
defensive shield templar. parry expert. fast rogue melee combatant)
Allows you to personalize and diverse characters alot.

Hacker theme: have ally symbols combine with you... could work well, visually. more like pickups tho...

Enemies.
cannon fodder. high reward targets(exp, gold). Basically have rewards in 1 clear place.
